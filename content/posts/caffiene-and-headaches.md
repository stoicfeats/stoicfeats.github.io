## 1. Is coffee a vasodilator or vasoconstrictor?
- Coffee (caffeine) is a **vasoconstrictor**.
- It narrows blood vessels, especially in the brain.
- After caffeine wears off, rebound vasodilation can occur, sometimes causing headaches.

## 2. Why caffeine constricts blood vessels
- Caffeine **blocks adenosine receptors**.
- **Adenosine** normally causes vasodilation and relaxation.
- When caffeine blocks these receptors, blood vessels **cannot widen**, resulting in **vasoconstriction**.
- This reduces blood flow and can temporarily relieve headaches or migraines.

## 3. Why headaches and migraines occur
Headaches and migraines result from disturbances in blood flow, nerves, and chemical signaling in or around the brain.

### Mechanism
- The brain itself has no pain receptors.
- Pain arises from **meninges**, **blood vessels**, and **nerves** (especially the trigeminal nerve).
- Triggers such as stress, dehydration, hormones, and sleep changes can cause:
  - Blood vessel **dilation**
  - **Inflammation**
  - **Trigeminal nerve activation**
- The trigeminal nerve releases **CGRP** and other chemicals that cause swelling and pain sensitivity.

### Why caffeine helps
- Caffeine **constricts dilated vessels**, reducing pressure and nerve irritation.
- It also **blocks adenosine**, which is elevated during fatigue and vasodilation.
- Hence, caffeine is often included in pain medications.

### Rebound effect
- Regular caffeine intake increases adenosine receptors.
- Sudden withdrawal allows excess adenosine to bind, causing **rebound vasodilation** and **withdrawal headaches**.

## 4. Difference between tension headache and migraine

| Type | Cause | Sensation | Key Triggers | Involvement |
|------|--------|------------|---------------|--------------|
| **Tension Headache** | Muscle tightness in head, neck, shoulders | Dull, tight band-like pain | Stress, poor posture, dehydration, eye strain | Muscular tension and mild nerve irritation |
| **Migraine** | Abnormal brain activity affecting blood vessels and trigeminal nerve | Throbbing, often one-sided, with nausea and sensitivity to light/sound | Hormonal changes, stress, sleep irregularities, certain foods | Blood vessel dilation, inflammation, neurochemical imbalance (serotonin, CGRP) |

### Summary
- **Tension headache** = muscle and stress-related.
- **Migraine** = nerve, blood vessel, and brain chemistry-related.
