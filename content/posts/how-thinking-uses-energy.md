here is a shorter but still complete, high-value version of the notes.
nothing important is removed — only repetition and long explanations are condensed.

## 1. how thinking uses energy

### brain’s fuel
- brain runs on glucose, taken directly from blood, not stored.
- even if your body has energy, your prefrontal cortex (pfc) can run low in real time.
- deep thinking rapidly increases:
  - glucose use
  - oxygen demand
  - dopamine, norepinephrine, acetylcholine usage

### where glucose is stored
- liver glycogen (accessible)
- muscle glycogen (not accessible to brain)
- so you can eat enough but still experience mental glucose dips.

### what happens when glucose drops
- weak working memory
- forgetting recent moves, numbers
- brain fog
- chaotic thoughts
- inner noise
- fast thinking

## 2. how many calories thinking burns

### baseline
- brain uses 20% of daily calories.

### experiments
- chess grandmasters: burn 4000–6000 calories/day during tournaments due to high cognitive load.
- mri studies: difficult thinking ↑ pfc glucose use by 12–25%.
- mental work study: ~100 extra calories burned during 3 hours of heavy thinking.

### conclusion
- thinking is not exercise-level burn per minute…
- but long days of mental stress significantly drain energy.

## 3. working memory = brain’s ram

### function

holds short-term info for a few seconds:
- game moves
- ball-by-ball details
- numbers someone tells you
- recent conversations
- tracking positions in games

### why your working memory feels weak
- constant internal thinking + self-talk
- planning and analyzing all day
- fast or intrusive thoughts
- overstimulated brain
- low dopamine periods
- glucose dips
- overactive default mode network (dmn)

all of this occupies your ram, so new info cannot enter or stay.

### result
- you forget recent events
- need to “force” yourself to remember
- lose track during games
- mix numbers
- can’t recall details unless you consciously switch on memory

## 4. prefrontal cortex overstretching

you overstretch the pfc when you:
- think all day
- simulate future scenarios
- talk to yourself internally
- consume too much information online
- process complex ideas
- plan constantly
- analyze productivity
- handle emotional thoughts
- visualize outcomes

symptoms of overstretching:
- poor retention
- mental fatigue
- weak recent memory
- fast thoughts
- intrusive or irrelevant thoughts
- inability to shut brain down

this is called cognitive overload.

---

## 5. fast thoughts, inner voice, and intrusive thoughts

these come from overactive default mode network (dmn) + low dopamine + mental fatigue.

signs:
- thoughts jump rapidly
- random mental chatter
- irrelevant words or lines popping up
- hard to stay silent in mind
- fast inner voice
- thinking while doing other tasks
- difficulty staying present

not hallucinations — just an overloaded thinking system.

---

## 6. retention problems (not remembering what you read)

you don’t retain new information because:
- your working memory is full
- neurotransmitters are low
- pfc is fatigued
- dmn is interrupting
- dopamine dips block learning
- too much content consumption, too little consolidation

so information never converts from short-term → long-term memory.

---

## 7. why deep thinkers can be lean

not always, but common because:
- higher cognitive calorie burn
- high stress raises metabolism
- lower appetite
- irregular eating
- constant glucose use by the brain

---

## 8. in one line summary

your mind is extremely active, always thinking, analyzing, and planning — this leads to:
- pfc overload
- working memory weakness
- dopamine instability
- glucose dips
- fast thoughts
- intrusive mental noise
- poor retention
- difficulty remembering recent events
