egocentric bias means **tendency to over-rely on one's own perspective and overestimate personal role or importance in events**.

it happens because we have better access to our own thoughts and feelings than others', so our brain fills gaps with self-centered assumptions.

---

### 🔹 simple definition

egocentric bias = **seeing everything through your own lens and thinking you're more important than you actually are**

---

### 🔹 real world example

imagine you're working on a group project with three other people.
you spend 4 hours researching and writing your part.
your teammates also spend 4 hours each on their parts.

but when the project is done, you think: "i did most of the work here."

that's egocentric bias — you remember your own effort vividly but underestimate others' contributions.

### 🔹 step-by-step example

1. **what happens:**

   - you focus on your own actions and feelings
   - you have detailed memory of your efforts
   - you have limited insight into others' work
   - your brain fills gaps with self-centered assumptions

2. **common situations:**

   - group projects: "i did most of the work"
   - conversations: assuming others share your views
   - relationships: believing you're investing more effort
   - conflicts: each person blames the other

3. **why it matters:**

   - distorts your self-view
   - creates conflicts and resentment
   - reduces empathy for others
   - leads to poor decisions

### 🔹 how to fix it

- **perspective-taking**: imagine others' viewpoints
- **seek feedback**: ask for others' accounts first
- **shared review**: discuss contributions factually in groups
- **mindfulness**: flag "i/me"-focused judgments
