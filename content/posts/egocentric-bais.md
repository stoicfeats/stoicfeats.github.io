egocentric bias means **tendency to over-rely on one's own perspective and overestimate personal role or importance in events**.

it happens because we have better access to our own thoughts and feelings than others', so our brain fills gaps with self-centered assumptions.

---

### ðŸ”¹ simple definition

egocentric bias = **seeing everything through your own lens and thinking you're more important than you actually are**

---

### ðŸ”¹ real world example

imagine you're working on a group project with three other people.
you spend 4 hours researching and writing your part.
your teammates also spend 4 hours each on their parts.

but when the project is done, you think: "i did most of the work here."

that's egocentric bias â€” you remember your own effort vividly but underestimate others' contributions.
