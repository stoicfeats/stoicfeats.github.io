- as a hiring manager, when i get a stack of resume's i immediately throw half of them out. i don't employ unlucky people.
- grown men don’t put cream or sugar in their coffee
- if the website's gradient is purple and blue then you know what it means...
- instead of "i'm bad at this", say "this is new for me". this gives your brain the space to learn instead of shut down. this is neuroplasticity in real time.
- chase that dream like you chased that girl that didn’t want you.
