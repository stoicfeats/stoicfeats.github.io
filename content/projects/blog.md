**compact blog template**

- title ·
- tl;dr (1–2 lines)
- hypothesis (measurable)
- method / architecture (diagram + tech list)
- required artifacts (repo, run commands, sample data)
- results (2–3 numeric metrics)
- lessons & trade-offs (3 bullets)
- follow-ups & repo link

**publication checklist**

- repo with `run.sh` / `docker-compose` ✔
- architecture diagram (png/svg) ✔
- one-page metrics report (md/csv) ✔
- 3–5 code snippets + key files in repo ✔
- seo tags & 3 keywords ✔
- publish date, read-time, difficulty tag ✔

1. cleaning the real world: reproducible etl with tests — mini — hypothesis: tests + docker reproduce clean load; metric: 100% tests pass on fresh env.
2. from api to analytics: idempotent ingestion patterns — mini — hypothesis: idempotency avoids duplicates; metric: 0 duplicate rows after 10 replays.
3. designing data lake zones: cost and partitioning trade-offs — intermediate — hypothesis: proper partitioning halves query scan bytes; metric: % scan-bytes reduction.
4. airflow in production: retries, backfills and testing — intermediate — hypothesis: robust dag reduces manual interventions; metric: increase in successful completion rate after retries.
5. building a realtime fraud detector: sliding windows and stateful processing — advanced — hypothesis: windowed aggregation detects anomalies within sla; metric: p95 latency and detection precision.
6. cdc for analytics: schema evolution without downtime — advanced — hypothesis: cdc + idempotent upserts keep analytic view consistent; metric: consistency rate after mixed ops.
7. feature stores demystified: offline-online consistency — expert — hypothesis: parity checks <1% mismatch; metric: offline-online mismatch %.
8. starting a data mesh: governance, contracts, and small experiments — expert — hypothesis: domain contracts reduce integration failures; metric: contract-violation detections prevented.
