### ðŸ”¹ what is rag?

retrieval-augmented generation (rag) is a technique that combines **information retrieval** with **text generation** to improve the quality and accuracy of ai responses.

instead of relying solely on pre-trained knowledge, rag systems:
- **retrieve** relevant information from external sources
- **augment** the input with this retrieved context
- **generate** responses based on both the query and retrieved information

---

### ðŸ”¹ how rag works

1. **query processing**: user asks a question
2. **retrieval**: system searches relevant documents/knowledge base
3. **augmentation**: retrieved information is added to the query
4. **generation**: llm generates response using both query and context
5. **response**: user receives accurate, contextual answer

### ðŸ”¹ rag components

**retrieval system:**
- vector databases (pinecone, weaviate, chroma)
- embedding models (openai, sentence-transformers)
- similarity search algorithms

**generation system:**
- large language models (gpt, claude, llama)
- prompt engineering techniques
- context window management

**integration layer:**
- api orchestration
- response formatting
- error handling and fallbacks
